Feiman-Nemser, Sharon, and Miriam Ben-Peretz, eds. Getting the Teachers We Need: International Perspectives on Teacher Education. London: Rowman & Littlefield, 2017.
>This edited book covers various topics in teacher education and development.  It argues that education (internationally) is often organized in an industrial model of devleopment and production. This book focuses on the fact that education needs to find ways to better educate the creative, adaptive, and entrepreneurial learner.  The authors note that this book is not about trying to radically change teacher education, but to better prepare teachers to education in the context of their environments of where they teach.  It also argues that "fast track" acadmeically able individuals to teacher education may not best serve schools because it focuses education on simply delivering information.

Gilbert, John K., Miriam Reiner, and Mary Nakhleh, eds. Visualization:  Theory and Practice in Science Education. Edited by J.K. Gilbert Vol. 3, Models and Modeling in Science Education. New York: Springer, 2008.
>This book is a series of articles that explain the importance of "external respresentations" - visualizations - have in science education.  They argue that as technology has increased, so has the need to use visualizations (animations, VR) can be used to make science class more interesting.  This book may not have the information I need on teacher development, but it could be an inspiration in the design process in thinking about science/math education and how to visualize that.

McGowan, Chris. Saving Science Class.  New York: Prometheus Books, 2017.
>The author in this book takes the view that today's current students have been "turned off" by science.  The author was able to spend time in the schools as a teacher and an observer.  He has also conducted extensive lit review and research.  He believes that the reasons studenst are turned off by science.  He then covers mostly what science is and how it should be taught.  This book is more case studies with some of his opinions.  Toward the end he discusses bad behavior from students during the science class.  His last chapter is really about bad behavior.  He's kind of grumpy.
